[*IMPORTANT NOTE: The initiated status is not a status monitored by the claims team. You must submit your claim for review, once all documentation has been uploaded.* Thank you for initiating your claim; Intent to claim has now been successfully sent to the carrier. In order to fully submit your claim, you must submit all of the required documentation through your Manage Claims tab in your Freight Club account within 30 days of the confirmation of loss. Once you have uploaded your documents in your claim tab hit Submit for Review. *IMPORTANT NOTE: Due to the high volume of claims, we encourage you to NOT submit your claim for review until you have the replacement invoice or proof of refund. Submitting your claim prior to uploading the proof of liability will lead to delays in your claim being filed. If the replacement is on backorder, you may upload a replacement confirmation as long as there is a cost.* Once the Freight Club claims team receives all of your claim documentation, you will either receive an email notification confirming the successful submission of your claim, or you will be notified that there are additional pending documents required to complete the submission. Once your claim is successfully submitted to the carrier, you can expect an average adjudication time of 30 - 45 days for shipments with UPS Capital Additional insurance coverage, or 60 - 120 days for claims filed directly with the transportation carrier. *Please note that due to peak season volumes claim adjudication may be slightly delayed.* As a reminder, the documentation required to proceed with your loss claim is as follows: - Commercial or Sales Invoice - Signed Bill of lading - Proof of liability (Refund, Replacement, Repair or Credit) If any other documents you have are not listed above, please add those documents to the additional documents area. Should you have any other questions, please reach out to claims@freightclub.com for assistance.
